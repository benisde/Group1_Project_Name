# <b> Vehicle Recalls </b>


This database is used to record and store details about recall campaigns, including the make and model of the recalled product, the issue that prompted the recall, the number of products affected, and the steps that need to be taken to address the issue. The database is designed to be easily searchable, so that consumers and industry professionals can quickly access information about the recalls that are most relevant to them. The database can be searched by product type, manufacturer, model year, and other criteria, which makes it easy to find information about specific recalls.

Transport Canada, as a regulatory body, uses this database to monitor the safety of vehicles and related products on Canadian roads. By tracking and publishing recall information, the database helps to ensure that consumers are aware of potential safety issues, and that manufacturers are held accountable for addressing them. The database also helps to promote transparency and accountability in the automotive industry, by making it easy for consumers to find information about recalls and the steps that manufacturers are taking to address them. Overall, the Vehicle Recalls Database is an important tool for improving the safety of vehicles, tires, and child car seats on Canadian roads and to protect the consumer.
